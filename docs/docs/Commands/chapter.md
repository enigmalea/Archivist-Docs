# Chapter Embed
*When a link is posted to a chapter update, your members might not need all of the info they'd get normally. Using the chapter command tells the bot you don't want the normal embed to post and instead would prefer the chapter embed.*

:::tip

Mods can enforce this behavior by chosing to have Archivist not respond with a normal fic embed if it detects that the work has chapters. Please see [Settings](./settings#settings-chdel-onoff) for more information.

:::

#### `$chapter [Chapter_#] [Chapter_Link]` ####
