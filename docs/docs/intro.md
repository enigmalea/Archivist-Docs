# Intro
The basic features of Archivist (viewing fic, series, and user info from AO3 links) require no commands! Simply invite the bot to your server and it will begin to detect links and post embeds.

The additional commands listed below offer additional customization and features.

### Ignore
There may be times you would rather have the bot NOT post an embed and the default embed from Discord is just fine. The bot comes with an "ignore symbol" which signals to it to ignore the link following.

This default symbol is `%`, however it can be customized by server owners or moderators with the **Manage Server** permission. See Settings for info.

| Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `%[AO3_LINK]` | `%https://archiveofourown.org/users/enigmalea` |
