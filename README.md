## About ##
This repository is for the website and documentation for the Discord bot Archivist. Archivist automatically detects links to fics hosted on archiveofourown.org, as well as series and user links, and replaces the nondescriptive default Discord embed provided by AO3's embed data with a rich embed of data scraped from the AO3 website.

You can learn more about Archivist or add it to your Discord server by [visiting the website](https://www.archivistbot.com).

## Technology ##
The website was built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) which uses a combination of markdown, React, javascript, html, and css to generate a static site. Although you do need to know those languages to change the style and composition of the site, you can absolutely add to and update information on the website without knowing any of those languages.

## Coming Soon ##
Please check back soon for:
- how to contribute to the docs
- how to report bugs/open issues
- and more!
