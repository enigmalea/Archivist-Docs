## About ##
This repository serves as the repo for the website and documentation and as a community hub for the Discord bot Archivist. Archivist automatically detects links to fics hosted on archiveofourown.org, as well as series and user links, and replaces the nondescriptive default Discord embed provided by AO3's embed data with a rich embed of data scraped from the AO3 website.

You can learn more about Archivist or add it to your Discord server by [visiting the website](https://www.archivistbot.com).

## Coming Soon ##

- how to contribute to the docs
